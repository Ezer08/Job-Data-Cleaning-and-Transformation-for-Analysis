Data Cleaning and Transformation Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and transforming job listing data to make it more structured, readable, and usable for further analysis. The dataset includes information about job titles, salaries, company details, locations, and more. The main objective is to clean the data, extract meaningful insights, and standardize formats to ensure consistency and usability.

Features and Objectives

Key Features:

Salary Range Extraction:

Extract minimum, maximum, and average salary estimates from salary strings.

Ensure salary values are cleaned, standardized, and converted to integers for easier analysis.

Job Description Cleaning:

Remove newline characters and extra whitespaces to ensure descriptions are concise and standardized.

Company Information Refinement:

Remove embedded ratings from the company name.

Extract and clean company-related details, including size, headquarters, and revenue.

Location and State Standardization:

Extract the state from job locations and map abbreviations to full state names.

Provide a complete and consistent view of job locations.

Column Renaming and Reorganization:

Rename columns for better readability (e.g., 'Salary Min estimated' to 'Salary Min (K)').

Reorganize columns for logical flow and ease of analysis.

Employee Size and Revenue Conversion:

Convert employee size and revenue ranges into structured formats.

Replace unknown values with appropriate placeholders.

Data Cleaning Steps

Initial Data Exploration:

Dataframe Dimensions: Checked using df.shape.

Column Types: Validated using df.dtypes.

Missing Values: Summarized using df.isnull().sum().

Duplicate Records: Identified and removed using df.duplicated().sum().

Data Cleaning Workflow:

Dropping Irrelevant Columns:

Removed the 'index' column to streamline the dataset.

Salary Data Processing:

Cleaned salary estimates by removing unnecessary characters ('$,' 'K,' 'Glassdoor est.').

Split salary ranges into minimum and maximum values.

Calculated and added a new column for average salary.

Job Description Cleanup:

Removed unwanted characters and whitespace.

Ensured descriptions are human-readable.

Company Name Standardization:

Extracted company names without embedded ratings.

Location and State Extraction:

Extracted states from the 'Location' column.

Mapped state abbreviations to full names using a predefined dictionary.

Column Renaming:

Renamed columns to provide clarity (e.g., 'Salary Min estimated' to 'Salary Min (K)').

Reordered columns for better usability.

Employee Size and Revenue Standardization:

Converted 'Size' values into structured numeric ranges.

Standardized 'Revenue' values into a uniform format.

Final Adjustments:

Dropped redundant columns (e.g., 'Salary Estimate').

Ensured the dataframe adheres to the desired column order.
